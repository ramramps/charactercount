this sample is based on bootstrap. 

sample use:

 In any JS file- refer the JS. Here I am using require  
  var charcount = require('durandal/plugins/charactercount');
  
  and you can enter
    charcount.characterCount($(<element>), <maxlength>)   - this will get the character count tooltip on the element.
    
  
  assumptions:
    placement is top.
    "enter" key is prevented.
